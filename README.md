# Robot2016
The Robot Code for the iRaiders 2016 Code!

## Eclipse Setup
The project files are now included. When importing from git, import as an existing project. Do NOT import with the new project wizard.

Once the project is imported, save the OpenCV 3.1.0 Java wrapper library as "(project root directory)/lib/opencv-310.jar".

## Deploying
In order to build/deploy from this branch, OpenCV 3.1.0 must be installed on the RoboRIO to /usr/local.
